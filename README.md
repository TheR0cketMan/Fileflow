## Installation

Getting Fileflow up and running is a breeze. Follow these steps:

1. **Download Fileflow:** Visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TheR0cketMan/Fileflow/releases) to download the latest release.

2. **Deploy to Web Server:** Deploy the Fileflow files to your web server of choice. You can use various web server solutions like XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP, or even host it on a remote web hosting service.

3. **Access Fileflow:** Open your web browser and navigate to the URL where you've deployed Fileflow.


## Advanced Configuration (Optional)

If you want to customize your web server's directory index settings, follow these steps:

1. **Open Your Web Server Configuration:** Depending on your web server software, locate and edit the appropriate configuration file (e.g., Apache's `httpd.conf`).

### Open Your Web Server Configuration

To configure your web server (e.g., Apache) for Fileflow, you'll need to locate and edit the appropriate configuration file. The exact location and name of this file may vary depending on your operating system and web server software. Here's how to find and access the `httpd.conf` file for Apache:

#### Windows:

1. If you're using XAMPP on Windows, navigate to your XAMPP installation directory. This directory is often located at `C:\xampp`.

2. Inside the XAMPP directory, open the `apache` subfolder.

3. Within the `apache` subfolder, locate the `conf` subfolder. This folder contains various configuration files.

4. Find and open the `httpd.conf` file using a text editor of your choice. You may need administrator privileges to modify this file.

#### macOS:

1. On macOS, you can use XAMPP as well. Navigate to your XAMPP installation directory, which is often found at `/Applications/XAMPP`.

2. Inside the XAMPP directory, open the `apache` subfolder.

3. Within the `apache` subfolder, find the `conf` subfolder. This is where you'll find the configuration files.

4. Locate and open the `httpd.conf` file using a text editor. You may need administrator privileges to edit this file.

#### Linux:

1. If you're using XAMPP on Linux, your installation directory might be at `/opt/lampp`.

2. Inside the XAMPP directory, open the `apache` subfolder.

3. Within the `apache` subfolder, locate the `conf` subfolder containing the configuration files.

4. Find and open the `httpd.conf` file using a text editor. You may need superuser (sudo) privileges to modify this file.

Once you've located and opened the `httpd.conf` file, you can proceed with the necessary configurations for Fileflow. Be sure to save any changes you make to this file, and if required, restart your web server for the changes to take effect.

Please note that the specific location and name of the configuration file may vary depending on your web server software. Refer to your web server's documentation for more information if you're not using Apache.


2. **Edit the DirectoryIndex (Optional):** Search for the `DirectoryIndex` directive and change it to your preferred directory index file, e.g., `DirectoryIndex index.php index.html`.

3. **Restart Your Web Server:** Save the changes and restart your web server software.

## Future Plans and Features
